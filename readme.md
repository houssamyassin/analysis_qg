# Multi-Surface QG Toolkit

This Python toolkit analyzes simulation output from a pseudo-spectral multi-surface quasigeostrophic model with time-dependent stratification. It provides inversion routines, spectral diagnostics, and plotting tools to explore flow properties and unravel energy transfers across scales.

Key features:

- *Potential Vorticity â€” Streamfunction Inversion*: Inverts potential vorticity fields into streamfunctions.

- *3D Vertical Structure Recovery*: Recovers the full three-dimensional vertical structure from the potential vorticity distribution on each surface.

- *Spectral Energy Budget Analysis*: Computes energy budgets in spectral space for the multi-surface system.

- *Normal Mode Diagnostics*: Analyzes eigenvalues, phase speeds, and growth rates of linear normal modes.

- *Visualization Tools*: Provides tools to plot fields on each surface and visualize isotropic energy spectra and inversion functions on log-log plots.

- *Fourier and Modal Utilities:* Provides helper routines for Fourier transforms and vertical modal decompositions.
