# Multi-Surface QG Toolkit

A Python toolkit for analyzing output from simulations using a novel multi-surface quasigeostrophic model with time-dependent stratification. This package provides inversion routines, diagnostics, and plotting tools to explore flow properties and unravel energy transfers across scales.

Key features:

- *Potential Vorticity â€” Streamfunction Inversion*: Inverts potential vorticity fields into streamfunctions using spectral methods.

- *3D Vertical Structure Recovery*: Recovers the full three-dimensional vertical structure from the potential vorticity distribution on each surface.

- *Spectral Energy Budget Analysis*: Computes energy budgets in spectral space for the multi-surface system.

- *Normal Mode Diagnostics*: Analyzes eigenvalues, phase speeds, and growth rates of normal modes for the linear problem.

- *Visualization Tools*: Provides tools to plot fields on layers visualize isotropic energy spectra and inversion functions on log-log plots.

- *Fourier and Modal Utilities:* Provides helper routines for Fourier transforms and vertical modal decompositions.
