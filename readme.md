# Multi-Surface QG Toolkit

A Python toolkit for analyzing output from simulations using a novel multi-surface quasigeostrophic model with time-dependent stratification. This package provides inversion routines, diagnostics, and plotting tools to explore flow properties and unravel energy transfers across scales.

Key features

- Potential vorticity / streamfunction inversion: Inverts potential vorticity fields into streamfunctions using spectral methods

- Recovers full three-dimensional vertical structure from potential vorticity distribution on each surface

- Compute energy budgets in spectral space for the multi-layer system

- Analyze eigenvalues, phase speeds, and growth rates of normal modes for linear problem

- Includes visualization tools to plot layer.

- Helper routines for Fourier transforms and modal decompositions
